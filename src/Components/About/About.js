          <p className='about__text'>Hello, my name is Varvara, and I’m a software developer.</p>

          <p className='about__text'>In my previous career, I worked as a lawyer for about 7 years. However, I decided to change my professional path and transitioned into the world of web development. This decision came from my passion for technology and problem-solving, and I wanted to build solutions that can impact the world around me.</p>

          <p className='about__text'>To make the switch, I completed several specialized courses in web development, gaining hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. Since 2022, I’ve been working as a full-stack web developer.</p>

          <p className='about__text'>I have experience working with technologies such as JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB. My primary focus is on creating user-friendly, responsive, and scalable web applications, and I enjoy both designing clean, intuitive interfaces and working with complex server-side logic.</p>

          <p className='about__text'>I had the opportunity to complete a 3-month internship in Tel Aviv, where I gained valuable experience and received positive feedback from my mentors and colleagues. During this internship, I contributed to several projects, worked in an agile team, and enhanced my problem-solving and collaboration skills.</p>

          <p className='about__text'>I’m constantly looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills, and I’m excited to be part of the ever-evolving tech industry.</p>

          <p className='about__text'>Feel free to check out some of my projects below!</p>
